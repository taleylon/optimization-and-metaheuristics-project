# Optimization and Metaheuristics Project
Defined and implemented using python a KKT optimization problem with two approaches to solve it:
1. Numeric methods such as Steepest Descent, Coordinate Descent and Golden-section search
2. Using an Atrificial Neural Networks model that was built from scratch using numpy
